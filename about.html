                        <p>Hi, I am a tech enthusiast and I work in the IT field. So far I work in the CI/CD team of a big corporation where a DevOps mindset is part of the culture.</p>
                        <p>As requirement of my work, I need to be always learning new tools and new technologies. IT evolves very quickly and you need to be aware of the existence of new the tools and its purpose. Just take a look here: <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank"> CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape</a>.</p>
                        <p>In my free time I like to sit in front of my desktop computer and build small Proof of Concepts in order to learn and test new tools.</p>
                        <p>I have created this blog for the next reasons:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                            <li><b>Learning</b>: The main objective that I want to aim by the creation of this blog is to improve my current technical skills and learn new ones.</li>
                            <li><b>Professional improvement</b>: As result of the first reason, I attempt to become a better professional and keep growing in my IT career.</li>
                            <li><b>Do real DevOps</b>: DevOps concept is a huge one, but letâ€™s say that one of the principles focuses in Knowledge Transfer. So what a better way than sharing my journey?</li>
                            <li><b>Have fun</b>: This blog does not aim to be completely serious. This is just about me sharing my ideas and notes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As I said, I am into CICD & DevOps. IMHO, a two very close topics.</p>
                        <p>My technological stack is Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Bamboo, Helm, Pipelines, Python, Ansible and GNU/Linux. So you can expect topics related to those tools or similar.</p>
